   The Q Code is just a code like urlencode, but its safe for the
   window.localtion.hash encode. I choosed the q out of the fact it
   is the 17 letter in the alphapet. So it possible to encode hex with
   A-P's. And the letter q is not used as much in the written languages.

   Use it and feel free, i never done any performance test

   V1.0
   Now the hash is more readable encoded
   I wrote a test in weet which try to find the odd behavior of the hash encoding
   I discovered that everything is allowed except:
    " " space ASCII 32
    "?" questionmark ASCII 63
   In all browser over than ie6 the exception are not valid
